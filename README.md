# Baruch-Pitney-Bowes-Data-Challenge
Repository is a collaboration of 3 team members taking part in the Pitney Bowes Data Challenge. Predicting machine failure is an important step in pre-emptive customer service that will allow Pitney Bowes to have a higher customer approval rating and hence higher client retention as the downtime for the clients reduces significantly. The machines are always connected to the cloud making the process of data collection streamlined and collected in real-time. This resource can be utilized to predict the failure of machines in the next seven days through prediction modelling. Seven days gives the company enough time to initiate the replacement process. 

Pitney Bowes Data Challenge is set by the one of the leaders in the mailing meters space. Participants are required to predict which machines are most likely to fail in the next 7 days.
